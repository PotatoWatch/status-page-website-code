# Status Page
 A status page website made in Flask.
 
## What is it?
A project I guess.

## Feedback
If you have any feedback on what I could improve in on any aspect of the code (I would prefer it if they were more on the Python code and not the HTML but both are welcome), open an issue and provide a brief description on what can be improved on.

## View it live:
The live (maybe) version (on REPLIT) can be found [here](https://status-page-python.potatowatch.repl.co).
